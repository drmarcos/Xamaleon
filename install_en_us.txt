   + Apache 2.2.21


One. Unzip your files on your server (localhost or online);
2nd. If you wish you can do that in sub-directories as htt ://localhost/meusProjetos/xamaleon;
3rd. Access the system via their browser in some settings may occur PHP page is blank, in this case
enter the full path eg htt :/ / localhost / meusProjetos / xamaleon / index.php;
4th. Carefully read the information provided during installation
5th. By default some settings are unset so that the system works as it was created and can be changed by you;
6th. If you encounter problems during installation, check the directory permissions;
7th. The system will automatically detect the physical and virtual paths of the application, it costs nothing to check to see if they are correct.
Eight. If you want, you can just use the file config.inc.php-dist changing information and saving it as config.inc.php. (do not add any lines to this file, just edit it using a text editor).
done this, simply access via the browser.
9th. You may make as many installations desired, they can be used simultaneously without problems.


If you find any problem with your installation, you can simply delete the file config.inc.php and start again. It is very quick and easy to do.
